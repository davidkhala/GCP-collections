## Deployment option

Browser, or any .jar runtime
> Because Looker is browser-based, deployment is faster than traditional BI models.
> Instead of waiting weeks or months, Looker customers can deploy the platform in hours because it ‘s packaged in a .jar file. The platform can be installed within the customer’s existing infrastructure and hosted on either the customer’s servers or Looker’s servers.
> Looker’s implementation team can also build a customized deployment plan that aligns with the client’s needs and requirements.
