Advanced API Security 
- continually monitors your APIs to protect them from security threats, including attacks from malicious clients and abuse.
- analyzes your API traffic to identify suspicious API requests, and provides tools to block or flag those requests if you decide to do so.
- In addition, Advanced API Security evaluates your API configurations to ensure they meet security standards, and gives you recommendations for improving them if needed.

### [Features](https://cloud.google.com/apigee/docs/api-security#advanced-api-security-features)
Advanced API Security uses the following process to protect your APIs:
1. API Security collects data for recent traffic passing through your APIs.
2. API Security analyzes the data to detect unusual traffic patterns that indicate a threat to your APIs.
3. API Security presents the results of the analysis in **Abuse detection | Security reports | Risk assessment** pages in the Apigee UI:
4. After reviewing the analysis, you can choose to block or flag requests from specific IP addresses using the **security actions** page. You can also create **security alerts**, which notify you of events related to API security.
